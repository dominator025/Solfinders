## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long until I feel results?**
A: Most people feel immediate calm from mandalas (10 min), clarity from Raagas (after 1-3 sessions), and wisdom integration from stories (after journaling). Lasting changes take 30+ days of consistent practice.

**Q: Do I need special equipment?**
A: No! Just yourself and a web browser. Headphones enhance Raaga experience but aren't required.

A: Absolutely! Digital Medicine is complementary, not a replacement for professional help. Use it alongside traditional medicine.

**Q: Is this religious?**
A: No. These tools are rooted in Indian wisdom traditions but are secular and accessible to all faiths.

**Q: What if I don't feel anything?**
A: Healing isn't always dramatic. Trust the process. Often the deepest shifts happen over weeks, not moments. Keep a journal to track subtle changes.

**Q: How often should I practice?**
A: Daily practice is ideal, but even 3x weekly shows results. Consistency matters more than duration.

A: Currently, journals are private and stored locally. In future versions, you'll be able to share or export them.

**Q: What if I feel emotional during practice?**
