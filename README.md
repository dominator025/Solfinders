## 📋 Project Overview

**Digital Medicine** is a comprehensive web application that transforms traditional Indian art, sound, and stories into accessible digital healing tools. By bridging ancient wisdom with modern technology, we address the fundamental truth: **Modern stress needs soulful solutions.**

### The Vision
In a hyperconnected world where mental health crises are at all-time highs, traditional stress management tools fall short. We need interventions that touch the soul—grounded in millennia of human wisdom. Digital Medicine brings together:

- **Sacred Sound Therapy** - Raagas and Vedic Chants
- **Interactive Mandalas** - Synchronized with your breathing  
- **AI-Powered Storytelling** - Panchatantra and Jataka Tales for inner wisdom
